## Description

This site is just a book search engine using the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books). Type some text into the input and books pop up.

## Key Features

- Log in or sign up with a new account by creating a new user.
- When you navigate away from the page your session information is saved so you don't have to login again.
- Search for books using the google books api.
- Save a book.
- Remove a book.
- View all of your saved books.

## Usage

Navigate to the [Book Search Engine](https://powerful-escarpment-59748.herokuapp.com/). To use the Book Search Engine, you have to have an account. Click on the Login/Signup in the navbar, and then the signup tab to create a new account. In order to sign up you must enter:

- A unique username
- A valid, unique email address
- A password

Once you are signed up and logged in, type in the name of a book to search for in the input form. When results come back, click the "Save this book!" button to save the book. If you navigate to the saved books tab (you can click the link "See Your Books" in the navigation bar), you can see all of your saved books. If you click the delete book button, you can remove a saved book from your saved book list. Click the logout nav link to log out, login by submitting your credentials on the login form, and that's it.

## Technologies Used

## Concepts Demonstrated
